# Cornifer

Cornifer is an intuitive data manager for empirical and computational mathematics. 

This project is still under development. It was inspired by my project [Beta Expansions of Salem Numbers](https://github.com/automorphis/Beta_Expansions_of_Salem_Numbers), where a (very old) version of this code can be found.

This project is named after the [helpfully humming navigational bug of Hallownest.](https://hollowknight.fandom.com/wiki/Cornifer)
